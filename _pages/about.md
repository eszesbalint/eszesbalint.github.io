Welcome to my world of innovation and creative exploration. I am Eszes Bálint, a recent Computer Science graduate, and I am thrilled to share my journey and experiences with you. With a burning passion for technology, I have embarked on a quest to push the boundaries of creativity and create impactful solutions.

## A Curious Mind and a Passion for Technology

Since my early years, I have been captivated by the world of technology and its endless possibilities. My insatiable curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a major in mathematical modeling from ELTE IK. Throughout my academic journey, I delved into the realm of mathematics, machine learning, computer graphics, and computer science, developing a deep understanding of these fields.

## Unleashing Creativity through Programming

While my formal education provided me with a solid foundation, I have always sought to apply my skills and knowledge to real-world projects. This drive led me to develop BDStudio, an innovative editor specifically designed for Minecraft's display entities. BDStudio allows Minecraft players to breathe life into their creations by providing a user-friendly interface and powerful tools for designing and customizing intricate displays. With BDStudio, users can showcase artwork, create interactive exhibits, and design immersive experiences within the Minecraft universe.

## Artistic Expression: Blending Technology and Creativity

Art has always held a special place in my heart, fueling my desire to create something extraordinary. Inspired by my grandfather, a gifted painter, I embarked on my own artistic journey, exploring different mediums such as digital painting and 3D modeling. However, it was the retro charm of ASCII art that truly captured my imagination, allowing me to merge my passion for technology with my love for art.

Through my art projects, I strive to blur boundaries and convey a message of acceptance. I firmly believe that art has the power to transcend differences and foster understanding. As a testament to my dedication, I have had the honor of showcasing my digital art at exhibitions, opening doors to new opportunities for organizing my own exhibitions and sharing my unique vision with the world.
