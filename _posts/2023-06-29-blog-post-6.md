We are thrilled to announce the release of BDStudio Beta 1.2, packed with exciting new features and enhancements that will elevate your Minecraft creations to new heights. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the latest changes and improvements in this release, including the highly anticipated support for item displays and a complete redesign of the GUI.

## Item Displays

With BDStudio Beta 1.2, we are introducing support for item displays, allowing you to showcase items in your BDStudio projects. Now, you can bring even more visual variety and creativity to your displays by utilizing item models. Whether you want to showcase weapons, tools, or decorative items, the item display feature empowers you to create captivating visual experiences in your Minecraft worlds.

## Redesigned GUI: Enhanced User Experience

We understand the importance of an intuitive and user-friendly interface when it comes to creating Minecraft models and designs. That's why we have completely redesigned the BDStudio GUI in Beta 1.2, focusing on improving usability and streamlining your workflow. Here are some of the key enhancements in the new GUI:

- **Top Toolbar for File Operations**: The new top toolbar provides easy access to essential file operations, such as creating, opening, and saving projects, ensuring a seamless experience while managing your creations.

- **Element Tools in the Elements Tab**: We have reorganized the element tools (Add, Duplicate, Group, Delete) and moved them to the Elements tab, making them more accessible and allowing for smoother model editing.

- **Enhanced Button Titles**: To simplify navigation and provide clearer guidance, we have added descriptive titles to several buttons, making it easier to locate and use the desired functionalities.

- **Modal Windows**: We have introduced modal windows for Version, Command, Block Search, and Item Search, enhancing your interaction and providing a focused environment for specific tasks.

- **New Color Palette**: The redesigned GUI comes with a fresh color palette, creating a visually pleasing environment that enhances your creative process and makes working with BDStudio a delight.

- **New Logo Design and Icon Changes**: BDStudio now sports a brand-new logo design, representing our dedication to innovation and quality. Additionally, we have made some icon changes across the interface, ensuring a consistent and polished visual experience.

- **Limited Support for Mobile Devices**: Recognizing the increasing use of mobile devices for Minecraft creation, we have made efforts to improve compatibility and provide limited support for mobile users, enabling you to work on your projects conveniently while on the go.

## Other Enhancements and Optimizations

In addition to the major features mentioned above, BDStudio Beta 1.2 brings several other enhancements and optimizations to enrich your modeling experience:

- **Unloadable Block States and Item Models Placeholder**: Unloadable block states and item models will now display a placeholder model, preventing disruption to your creative process and ensuring a smooth workflow.

- **Multipart Models Support**: Multipart models now properly support AND and OR clauses, offering increased flexibility and precision in your model designs.

- **Optimized Geometry**: We have optimized the geometry for models, resulting in improved performance and smoother rendering, allowing you to work on your projects more efficiently.

We are thrilled to provide you with BDStudio Beta 1.2, a release that not only introduces the exciting new feature of item displays but also delivers a complete redesign of the GUI for a more intuitive and enjoyable experience. We hope that these changes will unlock new possibilities for your Minecraft creations and inspire you to bring your imaginative visions to life.
